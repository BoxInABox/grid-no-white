pure javascript based image grid modules

So this Idea is also covered in other language and framework but I wanted to make it in a pure JS based scipt.
I was so Excited to do this because this is the first time I could ever relate my application level problem to some mathematics problem, also first time when I used pure mathematical solution for my practical proble. 

You can use this module implmentation when 
  1. You want to display many picures on one web page.
  2. You think a square grid is a crap and
  3. You want the grid to leave no white spaces like other similar JS offer.
  4. You want to maintain aspect ratio.
  5. When you change your browser's dimension, it should automatically re-do rendering, again in a best way.

Module still lacks in few points and I'm aware of these points already:
  1. if Image is so small it'll streach image and that makes the grid look like a creepy pirate flag.
  2. Actions before images are loaded
  3. self display when everything is loaded
